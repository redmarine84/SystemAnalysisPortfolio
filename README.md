**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

•	The client, DriverPass, wants a system to allow students to take online driver exams, schedule on-road training, display student information, track reservations, and display driving notes from the trainer taken during the training session.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I believe I did well in describing the purpose, requirements, and goals of the system.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would like to revise platform constraints. I feel that the information about the databases required would need to be more specific for the system. Like is the database going to be local or handle by a third party or a cloud based system.

H**ow did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I wanted to make sure that the user could change their password if needed and that the interface would be user friendly. It is important to consider what the user's needs are so that we can ensure that not only would they be happy with the usablility of the system but that they would feel secure when using it as well.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I like to first try an put myself into the clients shoes. I want to see the problem from their eyes that way I can make a more educate decision on my protocols I use when designing the system. I feel this would make me more invested in the project and concerned for the clients needs.
